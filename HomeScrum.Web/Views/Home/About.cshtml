   <p>
      Home Scrum is a very simple project tracking tool that is loosely built around the Scrum methodology of software development.
      I am not sure this tool will ever completely implement all of the functionallity required to truly do scrum, so if you are
      looking for a full fledged scrum management tool, you probably need to keep looking.  This is meant to be a scrum-like tool
      for personal use (or very small groups).
   </p>
   <p>
      Home Scrum was started because I wanted a simple project I could work on in order to practice using some technologies
      that I do not get to use often at my day job.  These technologies include:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>MVC</li>
      <li>Object-Relational Mapping (I am using NHibernate in this project, though I have also used Microsoft's Entity Framework)</li>
      <li>Dependency Injection (I am using Ninject for this project, though I have also used Unity and MEF)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      I decided to go with this tool because I needed a way to keep track of tasks that I needed to do on these side projects I work on.
      I only get to work on them sporadically, so I am constantly forgetting where I am on the project and what needs to be done.  So I
      figured I may as well make one of the projects be the building of a tool to help me out.
   </p>
   <p>
      I named it "Home Scrum" because I suck at naming things, I am primarily going to use it for tracking projects that I work on
      at home in my spare time, and I didn't want to waste precious time (or brain cycles) coming up with a better name.

               <h4>New Features</h4>
               <p>
                  This release reintroduces the details views rather than going directly into the editors in a read only mode.  This
                  seems to be a more intuative way to work with the system, and it makes it easier to concisely display the information
                  for larger entities such as work items.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This is also the first version released to Azure instead of on my home machine.

               <h4>New Features</h4>
               <p>
                  This release replaces the grey interface with some better colors, and reworks the editing
                  paradigm yet again, back to the original paradigm of first going to a read only details page,
                  and then clicking edit from there you wish to edit the item.
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Changed the theme to have more color</li>

                        <li>This makes the display of more complex data more intuitive</li>

                  <li>When editing a work item in this way, control returns to the sprint edit page after editing of the work item is complete.</li>
                  <li>
                     A handful of work item lists were added that will aid the user when either working on a sprint or planning a future sprint.  This are:
                     <ul>
                        <li>My Assignments - items assigned to the currently logged in user</li>
                        <li>Unassigned Backlog - backlog items currently not assigned to a sprint</li>
                        <li>Unassigned Tasks - any task currently not assigned to a sprint</li>
                        <li>Unassigned Problems - any problem type task currently not assigned to a sprint</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
               <ul>
                  <li>When a task is created from the backlog item screen, the task is now added to the backlog item's sprint if it is in one.</li>
                  <li>When a change in sprint or project is applied to a backlog item, the same change is now properly propagated to that backlog item's tasks.</li>
               </ul>

               <h4>Release Date: 2013/09/27</h4>
               <h4>New Features</h4>
               <p>Added pre-defined categories for the following entities:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Acceptance Criterion Statuses</li>
                  <li>Project Statuses</li>
                  <li>Sprint Statuses</li>
                  <li>Work Item Statuses</li>
                  <li>Work Item Types</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
               <ul>
                  <li>Fixed problems with certain values remaining null even though they appeared to default properly.</li>
                  <li>
                     Editors no longer throw exceptions if HTML tags are used in names or descriptions.  Instead, the
                     HTML tags are displayed as text.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     If no backlog items or stand-alone tasks are available to be assigned to a sprint, a message is now
                     displayed on the "Add" page.  Previously, the page would throw an exception upon posting the form.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     HTML tags and other special characters no longer cause an application error.  HTML tags may be used, but
                     not as markup.  That is &lt;strong&gt;strong text&lt;/strong&gt; shows up as &lt;strong&gt;strong text&lt;/strong&gt;
                     and not <strong>strong text</strong> .

               <p>
                  These prior versions were released at periodic times thoughout the development cycle just so I could use the system to track
                  what I was doing.

               <ul>
