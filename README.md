HomeScrum
=========

User Interface to the HomeScrum project.

The HomeScrum project is a simple task / project management tool that I am developing
that is loosly (perhaps very loosely) based around the "Scrum" methodology of
development.

Goals
-----

I am not developing this because we need yet another tool for this, but because I want
a sample application that I can play with to try working with things that are new to
me, and I want that application to perhaps be at least marginally useful to me.

At this time, I am using this project to learn the following technologies:
* NHibernate
* Ninject
* MVC 4.0
